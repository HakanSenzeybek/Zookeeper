The Animal Habitat Viewer is a user-friendly program that allows zoo staff to view different animal habitats. The program provides a menu of habitat numbers, and users can select a habitat to see the corresponding animal. It runs continuously without needing to be restarted and includes an exit option for easy program termination.
